This is a HTTP File Upload example. It allows you to upload
files to SD Card from a Web browser.

Use this example to connect MCB1700 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect MCB1700 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the 
address http://mcb1700/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The HTTP_upload example is available for one target:

MCB1700:       Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.
