The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
 - USART0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
  LPC1768 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)
  LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

这个例程演示：程序每隔1秒读取ADC值通过串口0输出。
VR1调节AD采样值
LD4...LD11 随VR1的增大而闪烁减慢。
使用时把JP7跳线冒拔掉。
